How to use Poligons Sounds’ Assets

Files Name
	The name follow this pattern:
		“funccion_assetname_loop.format”
	For example:
		“track_name_longloop.mp3”
		“stinger_popup.wav”

No looped áudio
These do not have description in the file name. They are called, “oneshot” audio. For example: 
“track_music.wav”. 
“sfx_sound.mp3”.
These audio files have a beginning and an end, these two points are not interconnected, being necessary its retrigger. Then, just put in and use.

Looped Track
	Those that are looped, have three kinds of loops: loop, longloop and shortloop.
	Loop File
Looped files have a beginning and an end connected. So, they can be automatically looped.
		Example: “track_name_loop.wav”	“sfx_shot_loop.mp3”
	Long Loop and Short Loop
		These kinds of loop are related, because long looped files can’t be looped alone. They, commonly have the introduction, if its a track, or have a reverb tail, if its a sound effect.
		Then, the shortloop file is the looped section of the bigger file.
		Then to use this files, you have to insert the longloop first, and at the end of the longloop, shot the shortloop. And every additional loop should be made with the short loop file.
		Example: “track_name_longloop.wav”	“track_name_shortloop.wav”
